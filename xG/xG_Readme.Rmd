# xG Readme

The two scripts contained in this folder contain the functions and process used to create our Expected Goals model (xG). The "xG_preparation.R" script contain the functons required to prepare the NHL RTSS data for modelling. The "xG_modelling.R" script contains the code we used to train our xG model using the `xgboost` package. 

Please read our detailed write-up about the model, where we cover the history of NHL xG models, our preparation and modeling process, the model results, and provide some example videos. The article can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/evolvingwild/395136). Additionally, if you have any questions about any and all of this, please feel free to reach out to us on twitter: @EvolvingWild. 


Thanks, 
Josh & Luke
